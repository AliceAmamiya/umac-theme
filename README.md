# Xaringan x UMAC

## What is it?
This is a modification of [TAMU](https://github.com/nanhung/xaringan-tamu) template following the [Identity Guide of University of Macau](https://www.umac.mo/about-um/university-identity/use-of-the-university-identity.html) with following features: 

- Nearly the same look of the PowerPoint version of presentation template
- Color schemes based on UMBG
- Chinese fonts support
- Few modifications from my supervisor

## How does it look like?
See the [demo](https://aliceamamiya.github.io/xaringan-x-umac/umac-slide-demo.html). 

## How to use it?
Step 1. Put your Rmd file and css files in the same folder.  
Step 2. Set the css part of the YAML metadata in your R Markdown file:
```
css: ["umac.css", "umac-fonts.css"]
```
Step 3. Knit and enjoy.
